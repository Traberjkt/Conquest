###About
<hr>
Conquest is long-term project that I will be doing coninuous work on when I can. 

The idea behind conquest is that you have 3 Resources Land/War/Economy. The building blocks of any city/state or government is Land to build and grow, War for Protection/Invasion and finally Economy for commerce. In Conquest you are the Conqueror, Leader and Ambassador. The point behind having 3 Resources is to offer 3 different playstyles, Land Slow and Exponetial Growth (Late Game). War Fast and Active style (Clicking & Ability Based). Economy takes traits & abilites from both and offers a (Balanced) game. 

Reasoning - I feel incrementals are extremely fun and addicting. The genre offers a hands off approach that I can make progress while afk and then while I am home I can manage what I want to happen while I am gone and I feel that offers a great element of gameplay if done right.

Why -  So why am I attempting this project? Well I want to learn CSS & JS, and later then be able to use angjularJS and Bootstrap. I also am interested in game design and would like to attempt balancing something small and simple and put some of my ideas into action. This is a learning project for me, I have never touched HTML/CSS or JS other than basic pages I want to use this project to demonstrate my progress and a self-learning project while in school. I currently have to take many General Education classes on the Communinty College level before I can transfer to a UC/Cal State. While taking the General Education classes I intend on tinkering with differnt Coding/Scripting Languages and Design Elements. 

Overall - This is a long-term project. This is a project that will never be truly complete. There will always be something I can improve upon. This is not intended to generate any revenue,

I was struggling with some simple CSS&HTML aspects and after analyzing some code from CoinClickerGame I feel that reading that CSS and HTMl is helping me greatly understand what I was doing wrong. Currently his code is being used for the UI as a base.
