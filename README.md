### Your Settlement awaits commander!

How will you rule? What resources are of importance to your settlement? Bloodshed and war perhaps? Maybe commerce and trade? No what about the exploration of land? What kind of Ruler will you be? The founding of a new settlement is an ongoing battle and of finding the right amount and importance in each resource.

###About this project
<hr>
 Hello everyone! I am currently a first year Computer Science Student in California! I am currently Attending Mount San Jacinto Community College to work on my general education studies. My end goal is to end up transfering to UC Riverside or UC Irvine. During my first year at Mount San Jacinto I will be taking general courses such as English, History and Baisc Math. To prepare for next year and get a head-start I figured I would embark on a self-learning project.
 
 I have been fascinated by the exponential growth of incremental games lately towards the end of 2015! So fascinated that I would like to take some time and put my skills to the test! Conquest was an idea I had while playing some of the incremental/clicking games of late. However coming from a MMORRP player I always felt like there was some flavor missing from the games. Each one was very alike however I feel they lacked player customization and control. Every game was buy the same heroes to get to a farther level or obtain a higher amount of main resource. I feel that there needs to be an incrementl/clicker that gives the player the ability to play the game their way! Would you like a slow exponential growth? Possibly a rapid clicking and ability management style? Balanced? That's when I figured I would create conquest. There would be three resources you choose the main one and depending on that choice would dicate your playstyle. 
 
 This game isn't intended to ever generate revenue however I do feel passionate about this project and would like to add on and build my skills along with this game. My main goals of doing this is to learn some basic HTML, CSS and JS as well as touch on some angluarJS and Bootstrap!I also would like to improve my knowledge of git and how github functions with repos, commits, forks, pull requests and all of that sort. My overall intended purpose is to further my learning while not being able to take Computer Science Classes at school and create an awesome game while doing so!
 
 Thanks for reading

I was struggling with some simple CSS&HTML aspects and after analyzing some code from CoinClickerGame I feel that reading that CSS and HTMl is helping me greatly understand what I was doing wrong. Currently his code is being used for the UI as a base.
