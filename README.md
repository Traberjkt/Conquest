### Your Settlement awaits commander!

How will you rule? What resources are of importance to your settlement? Bloodshed and war perhaps? Maybe commerce and trade? No what about the exploration of land? What kind of Ruler will you be? The founding of a new settlement is an ongoing battle and of finding the right amount of importance in each resource.

I was struggling with some simple CSS&HTML aspects and after analyzing some code from CoinClickerGame I feel that reading that CSS and HTMl is helping me greatly understand what I was doing wrong. Currently his code is being used for the UI as a base.
